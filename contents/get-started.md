# Overview

There are many benefits from using graph databases, but there are still some problems.
Relational databases have SQL as a common language, but graph databases currently do not have a common language.
Once you learn SQL, querying against relational databases is easy, but in the case of graph databases knowledge of database-specific query languages and graph formats is necessary.

To solve this problem, we developed a new REST API and its implementation, "X2" (read "Cross To").
We collected useful queries for graph visualization and provided them as a REST API. X2 saves you some time otherwise spent for annoying queries for graph databases. In addition, X2 returns a common graph-format (PG).
Now there is no need to worry about differences in formats between graph databases.
In short, if you would like to easily visualize your graph-data without worrying about database-specifications, all you need is X2. X2 is released as open source code on GitHub, so feel free to check it out.
